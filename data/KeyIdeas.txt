We can't unite as a community because we think our problems are different 
people living in different towers can't unite becuase each have unique problems
Everyone wants problem resolutions but feels helpless/uncordinated


Proposed Resolution: Decentralized approach to maintenance .
Where each Block/Tower can self manage/delegate certain ascpects of daily operations
Once we step out of our flats and stand on the ground we all are equally effected by everying which falls into practically common category
